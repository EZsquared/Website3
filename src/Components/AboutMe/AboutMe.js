            <p>I have been employed consistently since I was 14 years old. My first few years were spent working my way from Dishwasher to Assistant Chef. I then used that experience to roll into Deli Customer Service and eventually Quick Service Restaurant Management. Since then, that has been my typical track record; gaining a position at a company and <strong>working my way to the top</strong> through dedication, detail-focused work, and exceptional Customer Service. I continued to go to school throughout all of my early work experience, gaining new skills and concepts that expedited my rise at my workplaces.
            </p>
            <p>After I received a Bachelor’s in Business Administration with concentrations in both Human Resources and Marketing, I turned my attention to a specialized education in Golf and Sports Complex Revenue Management. I thoroughly enjoyed my path and quickly got started at a Semi-Private golf course. I taught juniors and gave lessons as a Golf Professional for a few years. By the end, I had worked my way from Range Picker to <strong>Account Manager, Director of Golf and only non-owner Signatory on a $2M revenue checking account</strong>. I used this time to discover the ins and outs of Accounts Payable/Receivable, Contract Negotiation, and exceptional Customer Service, both B2C and B2B.
            </p>
            <p>With my current trajectory scheduled to seat me in the Controller position, and a goal of General Manager inside 5 years, I started to realize my real passion was Technology. <strong>I had always been the unofficial “IT Guy”</strong> at every place I've worked. I had fiddled my way through figuring out common networking issues, hardware installation, and Operating System/Software troubleshooting. I always knew the POS better than anyone, and I knew that was for a reason. I took charge in upgrading workstations, internet packages, and phone systems to VOIP.
            </p>
            <p>This was the time when I knew, <strong>Tech is where I wanted to be</strong>. I understood that most people get started young in this field, but I also was confident in my ability and proven track record of learning new skills quickly and accurately. I figured that if I studied hard and kept at it, that eventually, down the road in life, I would be able to secure a job in this field. So I started my education and introduction to it all with a CompTIA A+ certification. I dove in trying to learn the basics of IT Support.
            </p>
            <p>It was through this process that I found Programming. It all seemed daunting and too much, but I broke off bite sized pieces as best as I could. With <strong>little to no extra monetary resources</strong>, I attempted to learn this industry for as economically as possible. There is a wide world of free resources and ways to learn. Setting my sight on the end goal, I went to work.
            </p>
            <p>Here I am, well into Programming with a strong understanding of <strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong>, and how that pertains to Web Frameworking. I chose <strong>Python</strong> as my first back-end language, and have tinkered with HTML and CSS as front-end languages. I have a check list of other languages and technologies I wish to gain experience in, and will work my way towards Full Stack knowledge. I have tried to attain exposure to what seems to be the most useful technologies to this industry, such as Git Version Control, SQL, Django, Command Line, and HTML/CSS/JS. I plan on expanding my knowledge on JavaScript and learning other languages commonly associated with Web/AboutMe Development. <strong>Junior Developer, here I come!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>What I need now, and am actively looking for, is that start. The start I so famously have been known to take full advantage of. The ability to <strong>hit the ground running and soak up everything around me</strong> will catapult me within the company I work for. Adaptiveness, Loyalty, and trustworthiness have been the backbone of my working career, and I can’t wait to prove that to you!
